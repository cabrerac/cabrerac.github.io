	abstract = {As use of data driven technologies spreads, software engineers are more often faced with the task of solving a business problem using data-driven methods such as machine learning (ML) algorithms. Deployment of ML within large software systems brings new challenges that are not addressed by standard engineering practices and as a result businesses observe high rate of ML deployment project failures. Data Oriented Architecture (DOA) is an emerging approach that can support data scientists and software developers when addressing such challenges. However, there is a lack of clarity about how DOA systems should be implemented in practice. This paper proposes to consider Flow-Based Programming (FBP) as a paradigm for creating DOA applications. We empirically evaluate FBP in the context of ML deployment on four applications that represent typical data science projects. We use Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) as a baseline for comparison. Evaluation is done with respect to different application domains, ML deployment stages, and code quality metrics. Results reveal that FBP is a suitable paradigm for data collection and data science tasks, and is able to simplify data collection and discovery when compared with SOA. We discuss the advantages of FBP as well as the gaps that need to be addressed to increase FBP adoption as a standard design paradigm for DOA.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) creates environments where devices and users interact. Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) encapsulate devices’ capabilities as IoT services which users can request. SOAs manage the scale of IoT services by placing services descriptions about appropriate services in distributed architectures (e.g., a network of IoT gateways). Such distribution increases the chances of responding to users in an efficient fashion as requests are attended locally. However, dynamic IoT environments can easily outdate the distribution of services descriptions, which in turn impacts SOAs efficiency when the required services descriptions are not in place. Current architectures use pre-defined knowledge to adapt the distribution of services descriptions reactively. However, such human intervention is not always available and may be error-prone in dynamic IoT environments. We propose a reinforcement learning model that IoT gateways use to automatically decide how to distribute services descriptions over time. We evaluate the model in a real IoT testbed and results show that its performance in different scenarios compares favourably against a reactive baseline.},

	abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of physical devices, distributed over a large geographic area, provide a near real-time state of the world. These devices’ capabilities can be abstracted as IoT services and delivered to users in a demand-driven way. In such a dynamic large-scale environment, a service provider who supports a service level agreement (SLA) can have a comprehensive competitive edge in terms of service quality management, service customization, optimized resource allocation, and trustworthiness. However, there is no consistent way of drafting an SLA with respect to describing heterogeneous IoT services, which obstructs automatic service selection, SLA negotiation, and SLA monitoring. In this paper, we propose an ontology, WIoT-SLA, to achieve semantic interoperability. We combine IoT service properties with two prominent web service SLA specifications: WS-Agreement and WSLA, to take advantage of their complementary features. This ontology is used to formalize the SLAs and SLA negotiation offers, which further facilitates the service selection and automatic SLA negotiation. It can also be used by a monitoring engine to detect SLA violations by providing the semantics of service level objectives (SLOs) and quality metrics. To evaluate our work, a prototype is implemented to demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.},
