  I am Christian Cabrera-Jojoa a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Cambridge. 
  My current research addresses the problems and challenges that arise from the deployment of 
  Artificial Intelligence systems in the real world. Previous to this position, I was a Postdoctoral 
  Research Fellow at Trinity College Dublin, where I also received a Ph.D. in Computer Science (2020). 
  My research at Trinity focused on context-aware, pervasive, and resilient systems architectures for 
  large, distributed, and dynamic urban environments.

   We are already witnessing the benefits that the new AI-based technologies can bring to our lives. 
   The panorama is even more promising if we consider the evolution speed of these technologies. 
   However, we must understand how to deploy and integrate these technologies in the real world. Such an 
   understanding will help us to enable a democratic realization of the promised benefits and to avoid the 
   threats that these new technologies also create.

   The solution to this problem is not trivial and requires collaboration between diverse scientific areas 
   (e.g., computer science and engineering, social sciences and philosophy, etc.). My current research approaches 
   this problem by studying AI technologies as software entities that are part of larger software systems. 
   These systems must be designed and implemented to cope with changing and complex requirements from dynamic 
   environments in an optimal fashion.

   This website presents the outputs of my current and previous research, as well as content that I find 
   interesting to share.
